I am a physical chemist by training with a background in scientific computing, specializing in biological systems. Specifically, I have integrated principles from chemistry, physics, and statistics to investigate diverse phenomena within bacterial cells, such as a regulatory mechanisms for stress response and the interplay between the transcriptome and proteome.  In my career, I have achieved proficiency in a wide array of computational tools to design and implement analytical pipelines within multiple differ- ent environments (HPC, AWS, Docker, Conda) on various operating systems (Linux, MacOS, Windows) leveraging both custom and pre-built software packages with standard coding languages (Python, R, Bash, etc). Additionally, I have developed skills in de- signing, managing, and contributing to exploratory multi-year projects that require flexibility, self-assessment, reproducibility, and publication-level documentation. I have extensive experience working in highly collaborative environments, both domestically and internationally, and I am well practiced in presenting technical material to audiences of varying subject-matter expertise.


I am particularly interested in computational work targeting biological systems. I believe my background using computation to probe biological systems through simulations or bioinformatic tools could be a strong fit for roles at Incyte. While I am open to many types of positions, I'm especially keen on R&D and/or data science related roles. I have attached my resume for reference to provide more context about my background.
