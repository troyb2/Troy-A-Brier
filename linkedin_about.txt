I am a physical chemist by training with a background in scientific computing, specializing in biological systems. My graduate work employed bioinformatics, kinetic modeling, and next-generation sequencing analysis to understand how bacterial gene expression evolves and fluctuates. I am proficient in an array of computational tools for designing and implementing pipelines within multiple computing environments (HPC, AWS, Docker, etc.) on various operating systems (Linux, macOS, and Windows) leveraging both custom and pre-built software within standard coding languages (Python, R, Bash, etc.). I have extensive experience working in highly collaborative environments, both domestically and internationally, and I am well-practiced in presenting technical material to audiences of varying subject-matter expertise. My current interests lie in computational work targeting biological systems. I am particularly interested in R&D and/or data science-related roles. 

Feel free to connect with me; I am always happy to discuss.
