I am a physical chemist by training with a background in scientific computing, specializing in biological systems. 

Specifically, I have integrated principles from chemistry, physics, and statistics to investigate diverse phenomena within bacterial cells, such as a regulatory mechanisms for stress response and the interplay between the transcriptome and proteome.  

I have achieved proficiency in a wide array of computational tools to design and implement analytical pipelines within multiple different computing environments leveraging both custom and pre-built software.

I have developed skills in designing, managing, and contributing to exploratory multi-year projects that require flexibility, self-assessment, reproducibility, and publication-level documentation. 

I have extensive experience working in highly collaborative environments, both domestically and internationally, and I am well practiced in presenting technical material to audiences of varying subject-matter expertise.


My current interest lie in computational work targeting biological systems. I'm especially keen on R&D and/or data science related roles. 


Feel free to connect with me to discuss.
