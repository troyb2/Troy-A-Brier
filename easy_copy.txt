GRADUATE/ POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH ASSISTANT   01/2018-12/2024
The Luthey-Schulten Group at Univeristy of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
– Doctoral Dissertation: Shaping the bacterial transcriptome: Perspectives from kinetic modeling
– Constructed a stochastic kinetic model using data collected from super-resolution imaging experiments to simulate the sugar-stress response in Escherichia coli.
– Collaborated in the use of GPU-accelerated, hybrid stochastic-deterministic methods to simulate whole-cell models of bacteria that capture the reaction and diffusion of ∼10,000 biochemical components at the cell-scale.
	* Constructed a kinetic model of the nucleotide metabolism for a bacterial cell.
	* Curated genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and kinetic rates from experiments/databases.
	* Updated software/code for use on high performance GPU cluster.
– Developed a methodology to profile the bacterial transcriptome coupling bioinformatics and computational analysis of NGS experiments.
	* Built a sequence-alignment based pipeline to identify genetic motifs within a bacterial genome and predict transcriptional events.
	* Analyzed Illumina, Pacific Biosciences, and Oxford Nanopore Technologies RNA sequencing experiments.
	* Created tools to predict transcription units and visualize the RNA isoforms.
– Assisted PI in preparation of grant materials to acquire federal funding: NSF MCB 2221237 - $2.00M (proposal, annual reports) | NSF MCB 1818344 - $1.50M (annual reports) | NSF MCB 1840320 - $1.18M (annual reports).
– Maintained group’s GPU cluster and website.
– Collaborated with industrial and academic partners, both domestic and international.
– Presented research results to broader scientific community at domestic and international conferences.


Primarily worked to validate and complete a manuscript on the development of a methodology to profile the bacterial transcriptome coupling bioinformatics and experiment. This included buildingt a sequence alignment based pipeline to identify genetic motifs within a bacterial genome and predict transcriptional events, analyzing Illumina, Pacific Biosciences, and Oxford Nanopore Technologies RNA sequencing experiments, and creating tools to predict transcription units and visualize the RNA isoforms.
