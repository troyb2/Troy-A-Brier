	\begin{cvletter}
		\lettersection{About Me}
		%doesnt really need to change job by job as long as they are computational with "research focus"
		I am a physical chemist by training with a background in scientific computing, specializing on biological systems.
		Specifically, I have integrated principles from chemistry, physics, and statistics to investigate diverse phenomena within bacterial life, such as regulatory mechanisms for stress response and the interplay between the transcriptome and proteome.	
		In my career, I have achieved proficiency in a wide array of computational tools to design and implement analytical pipelines within multiple computing environments (HPC, AWS, Docker, Conda) on various operating systems (Linux, MacOS, Windows) leveraging both custom and pre-built software with standard coding languages (Python, R, Bash, etc).
		Additionally, I have developed skills in designing, managing, and contributing to exploratory multi-year projects that require flexibility, self-assessment, reproducibility, and publication-level documentation.
		I have extensive experience working in highly collaborative environments, both domestically and internationally, and I am well practiced in presenting technical material to audiences of varying subject-matter expertise.
		
				
		\lettersection{Why \companyname?}
		%how do i fit the mission of the company / goals
		My former experience has given me a deep appreciation for scientific innovation and the need for more efficient and accelerated methods to extend innovation beyond the laboratory and into the real world. 	
		Therefore, I am particularly drawn to \companyname's mission to make personalized genetic testing and diagnostics part of the standard of care to protect health and enable earlier and more targeted interventions that lead to longer, healthier lives.
		Human biology is complex, and the treatment for one is not guaranteed to be the treatment for another.
		I am inspired by~\companyname's commitment as a global leader in medical testing working to fundamentally change the management of disease worldwide by implementing relatively simple testing to detect disease early and proactively inform treatment.		
%		Furthermore, \companyname's dedication to empowering scientific exploration with AI/ML tools is appealing to me and aligns with my personal philosophy of wanting to push the boundaries of knowledge using computational innovation.
		I am excited at the opportunity to join the \companyname~team and contribute to its vision with my computational skills.
				
		
		\lettersection{Why Me?}
		%should talk about things on the job listing skills i have 
%		I am think I am a quality candidate for the \brole~at the \companyname.
		As a computational chemist and biophysicist I would bring a deep understanding of biological research complemented by hands-on experience in scientific computing across diverse operating systems and environments. %understanding of fundamental biological principles+working proficiency in Unix/Linux operating system
		I have significant knowledge of Python and am proficient in R as tools to solve complex scientific questions including developing custom code for simulation and data analysis.
		TThroughout my career I have worked with many data sets of varying type and size, and I am confident in my capacity to adapt, manage, and utilize new data sets  to address challenging questions, regardless of data size.
		Most relevant to the position is my previous experience with NGS sequencing data from varying methodologies (Illumina, PacBio, and ONT), where I integrated various software and algorithms to compare and predict complex relationships between the data sets. 
		 %learn quickly ability to apply skills
%		While my AI/ML experience is currently foundational, I have experience with AI/ML approaches such as AlphaFold2 and ChatGPT, and I am  very eager to learn more and employ them towards real world applications.
%		My ability to achieve and communicate scientific discovery is exemplified through my publication and presentation record.
		In summary, I believe my problem-solving abilities, commitment to learning and integrating novel techniques across disciplines, and aptitude for collaboration makes me an ideal candidate for the \brole~position at~\companyname.
