	\begin{cvletter}
		\lettersection{About Me}
		%doesnt really need to change job by job as long as they are computational with "research focus"
		I am a physical chemist by training with a background in scientific computing focusing on biological systems.
		Specifically, I have integrated principles from chemistry, physics, and statistics to investigate diverse phenomena within bacterial cells, such as a regulatory mechanisms for stress response and the interplay between the transcriptome and proteome.	
		In my career, I have achieved proficiency in a wide array of computational tools to design and implement analytical pipelines within multiple different environments (HPC, AWS, Docker, Conda) on various operating systems (Linix, MacOS, Windows) leveraging custom and pre-built software packages with standard coding languages (Python, R, Bash, etc).
		Additionally, I have developed skills in designing, managing, and contributing to exploratory multi-year projects that require flexibility, self-assessment, reproducibility, and publication-level documentation.
		I have extensive experience working in highly collaborative environments, domestically and internationally, and I am well practiced in presenting technical material to audiences of varying subject-matter expertise.
				
		\lettersection{Why \companyname?}
		%how do i fit the mission of the company / goals
		My former experience has given me a deep appreciation for scientific innovation and the need for more efficient and accelerated methods to extend innovation beyond the laboratory and into the real world. 	
		Therefore, I am particularly drawn to \companyname's mission to fundamentally change life sciences research and accelerate the pace of biomedical discovery.
		As a start-up in biomedical research, I am inspired by~\companyname's commitment to improve the accessibility of genomic data by reducing the known difficulties with producing and handling such data. 
		Furthermore, \companyname's dedication to empowering scientific exploration with AI/ML tools is appealing to me and aligns with my personal philosophy of wanting to push the boundaries of knowledge using computational innovation.
		I would welcome the opportunity to join your team to contribute to making the company's vision a reality.
		
		\lettersection{Why Me?}
		%should talk about things on the job listing skills i have 
%		I am think I am a quality candidate for the \brole~at the \companyname.
		As a computational chemist and biophysicist I would bring a deep understanding of fundamental biological principles, complemented by hands-on experience in scientific computing across diverse operating systems and environments. %understanding of fundamental biological principles+working proficiency in Unix/Linux operating system
		I have significant knowledge of Python and am proficient in R as tools to solve complex scientific questions including the processing and handling of multiple types of NGS data sets.
		Throughout my career I have worked with many different types and sizes of data sets, so I am confident in my capacity to adapt, manage, and utilize new data sets regardless of size for addressing challenging biological questions.
		 %learn quickly ability to apply skills
		While my AI/ML experience is limited, I very eager to learn more and employ it towards real world applications.
		My ability to achieve and communicate scientific discovery is exemplified through my publication and presentation record.
		In summary, I believe my problem-solving abilities, commitment to learning and integrating novel techniques across disciplines, and aptitude for collaboration makes me an ideal candidate for the \brole~position at~\companyname.
